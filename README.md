# About

This repository contains the Software development kit for the [Adrastea-I Cellular module](https://www.we-online.com/en/components/products/ADRASTEA-I). It guides you the process of installing the tool chain, the IDE and provides the example source code for developing embedded applications on the Adrastea-I platform.

The Adrastea-I module is a compact LTE-M/NB-IoT cellular module with integrated GNSS, an ARM Cortex-M4, and 1MB Flash memory for customer-developed applications. Based on the Sony Altair ALT1250 chipset, the Adrastea-I module provides AT-command-based multi-band configurability, enabling international, multi-regional coverage in LTE Cat M1 / NB1 radio access technologies.

Adrastea-I includes a fully integrated global navigation satellite system solution that supports GPS and GLONASS positioning systems.

> [!NOTE]  
> This repository is intended for use by embedded software developers for developing applications on the Adrastea-I module.

## Adrastea-I Docker-Based Toolchain and Utilities 

### Prerequisites

To use the Docker toolchain, you need to set up the Docker Engine on your host machine. Please follow the instructions below.

[Install Docker Engine on Windows and Linux](docs/development-environment/docker-toolchain/docker_toolchain/docker-engine-installation.md)

### Adrastea-I ‚Äì Docker-Based Toolchain Installation

The Adrastea Docker-Based Toolchain Guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up and using a Docker-powered development environment. It covers installing Docker, configuring the toolchain, managing dependencies, and running builds within isolated containers. This guide ensures a consistent and efficient workflow across different systems, making development, testing, and deployment more reliable and reproducible.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Set the minimum memory and CPU parameters in the `<your_workspace>\docker\build_targets\build.yml` file. Increase the values based on your local hardware capabilities (e.g., set memory to 16GB and CPUs to 4.0). The minimum configuration uses 8GB of memory and 1.0 CPU.
